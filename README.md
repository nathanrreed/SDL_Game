Created with SDL3 to make a simple game engine in C.

Currently just a proof of concept for rending and taking input

Draws a simple map from a file and lets the player walk around using wasd. Buttons can be selected by clicking on them or by using the arrow keys and enter.

A basic options menu is included that lets the player change the resolution with a dropdown menu.
